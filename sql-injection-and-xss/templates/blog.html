<p>The Australian Defence Force will support the NSW flood emergency efforts from Tuesday.

    <br /><br />“Emergency Management Australia have received an official request for assistance from NSW,” a spokesman from the Prime Minister’s office said.

    <br /><br />“The request is for two search and rescue helicopters operating out of the NSW south coast for 24-hour operations. ADF will be able to provide this support and will commence service tomorrow.”

    <br /><br />Emergency Management Australia is a division of the Department of Home Affairs.

    <br /><br />Earlier today, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said they expected a formal request to be made from the NSW government.

    <br /><br />“We understand this is likely to be for recovery support and clean-up operations, including personnel, vehicles and machinery,” he said. “The Premier [Gladys Berejiklian] and I were discussing that over the weekend.”

    <br /><br />He said the ADF was “readying itself for this task that still lays ahead”.

    <br /><br />“Particularly in the recovery phase,” Mr Morrison said. “It is working closely with NSW Emergency Services to co-ordinate potential areas for assistance.”</p>
